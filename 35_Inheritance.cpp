// Inheritance
/*
heritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that
allows one class (called a derived or child class) to inherit the properties
and behaviors (methods) of another class (called a base or parent class).
This promotes code reusability, modularity, and the ability to create
a more natural and hierarchical relationship between classes.

// Key Concepts of Inheritance
// Base Class (Parent Class):
// Derived Class (Child Class):
// Access Specifiers:

// funfact:  LAB SKILLS(1st base class) --------> LAB STUDENT(child class/Derived class) <------------- ASSISTANCE KNOWLEDGE(2nd base class)

// Forms of inheritance 
/*
o) Single Inheritance  (Derived class have only one Base class)
1) Multiple Inheritance (Derived class with more than one Base class) [ak bachha 2 bapp]
2) Hierarchical Inheritance (Several Derived class with single Base class) [ak bapp ke ki sare bacche]
3) Multilevel Inheritance (Deriving a class from already derived class) [grandfather ---> papa -----> child {deriving class from already derived class}] {and child = papa + more}
4) Hybrid Inheritance (Combination of multiple inheritance and multilevel inheritance) [Animal --------> Mammal and Reptiles ----------> Crocodile ]

----->  Private members: Accessible only within the class itself and friends, not in derived classe
