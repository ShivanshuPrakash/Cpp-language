//Polymorphism
//Polymorphism allows for the use of a single interface to represent different underlying data types
//- one name and multiple forms
//- eg. Function overloading, operator overloading
//- virtual overloading

// types of polymorphism
//1) Compile TIme Polymorphism
//2) Run time polymorphism


//Compile Time Polymorphism  also called early binding and static binding
   // Compile-time polymorphism is resolved during compilation. It is achieved through:
                         // :  Operator overloading : Defining new behavior for existing operators.
                         // :  Function Overloading : Multiple functions with the same name but different parameter lists.
// Run time polymorphism 
//                  achived by: Virtual Functions :A function declared in a base class and overridden in a derived class. 
                                //                 It ensures that the correct function is called for an object, regardless of the type of reference (or pointer) used for function call.
